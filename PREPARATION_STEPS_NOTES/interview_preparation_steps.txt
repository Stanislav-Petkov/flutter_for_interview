71. code quality tools
Code Quality Tools
Static Analysis:
Use 'dart analyze' to detect issues in your code (e.g., unused imports,
potential errors).
Add it as part of your CI/CD pipeline for automatic checks.
Linting:
Use the 'flutter_lints' or 'pedantic' package for style guidelines
and catching common errors.
Customize the .analysis_options.yaml file to enforce consistent
coding standards.
Code Formatting:
Use 'dart format' to ensure your code follows a consistent style.
Code Coverage:
Use 'flutter test --coverage' to check how much of your code
 is covered by tests.

70. What is the bloc pattern
https://www.mitrais.com/news-updates/getting-started-with-flutter-bloc-pattern/
Bloc is a design pattern created by Google to help separate
business logic from the presentation layer and enable a
developer to reuse code more efficiently.
BLoC (Business Logic Component) is a popular architectural pattern
in the Flutter community for building scalable and maintainable
apps. It provides a clear separation of concerns between
the user interface and business logic, making the codebase
 more organized and easy to understand.

https://www.flutterclutter.dev/flutter/basics/what-is-the-bloc-pattern/2021/2084/
Difference between the pattern and the package
Although the BLoC pattern is one of the officially recommended state
management approaches, there is no direct native support from Flutter.
Instead, you either implement it yourself or go for a package that
has already implemented all the boiler plate code for you. This
is where the bloc package comes into play. It provides
all core classes that are necessary to use the pattern.

69. Does the main thread bloc when the user is waiting for
 something from the backend
No, the main thread does not block when the user is waiting for
something from the backend in Flutter. This is because network
requests are handled asynchronously.  When you make a network
request in Flutter (or any other Dart code), it's done via Dart's
Future mechanism, which uses non-blocking I/O. This means that the
 main Dart thread can continue doing other work, like responding
 to user interactions,
while the network request is being processed.

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64520013/dart-future-blocking-main-thread
As Dart uses an event loop, all code (synchronous and asynchronous)
will simply be run on the same isolate (think thread in other languages
as an analogy), just at different points in time. As such, when
your process method is dequeued and executed, it will block the
thread and cause frames to be dropped due to a longer execution
time, despite being asynchronous. The optimal solution to the
problem is to spawn another isolate in a new thread, and carry out
the computation there. Flutter provides a convenience method for this
exact use case, called compute. It takes a top-level function (not in
a class, nor anonymous) that can have a primitive type parameter
(including Map and List) as an argument and will return at some point
in the future. For more information on compute, see its documentation
linked above.

68. How can isolates interact with each other
https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.3.1/dart-isolate/Isolate-class.html

67. Are isolates using different areas of the  memory?
Yes, isolates in Dart use different areas of memory.
Each isolate has its own memory heap and does not share
memory with other isolates. This isolation ensures that
there is no need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms,
making isolates a safe way to run concurrent code.

66. Is dart single threaded language.
Yes, Dart is a single-threaded language. It uses an event
loop and asynchronous programming to handle tasks that
might block the main thread, such as I/O operations.
For parallelism, Dart uses isolates, which are separate memory heaps
that run in parallel and do not share memory.

65. rxdart
have you used rxdart?
can we use it to implement a bloc as in bloc library?
Yes, you can use rxdart to implement a BLoC (Business Logic Component)
pattern similar to the bloc library. Below is a step-by-step plan
and the corresponding code to implement a simple BLoC using rxdart.
Plan
Create a BLoC Class: Define a class that will manage the state and
business logic.
Define Input and Output Streams: Use rxdart to create StreamController
for input and output.
Expose Streams: Expose the streams to be used by the UI.
Handle Business Logic: Implement methods to handle business logic
and update the streams.
Dispose: Ensure to close the streams to avoid memory leaks.


64. First class level functions
In Dart, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be
 assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions,
  and returned from other functions. This allows for a high degree
   of flexibility in how functions are used and manipulated.
Key Points
Assigning Functions to Variables: You can assign a function to a variable.
Passing Functions as Arguments: Functions can be passed as
arguments to other functions.
Returning Functions from Functions: Functions can return other functions.

63. ffi
Dart FFI (Foreign Function Interface) allows you to call native
C APIs from Dart code. This is useful for integrating with existing
native libraries or for
performance-critical code that needs to be written in C or C++.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface
A foreign function interface (FFI) is a mechanism by which a
program written in one programming language can call routines
or make use of services written or compiled in another one.
An FFI is often used in contexts where
calls are made into a binary dynamic-link library.

Used to:
How to call a C function with no arguments and no return value.

When to Use Dart FFI:
Performance-Critical Code: When you need to execute
performance-intensive operations that are better handled in C or C++.
Existing Native Libraries: When you want to leverage
existing native libraries without rewriting them in Dart.
Platform-Specific Features: When you need to access
 platform-specific features that are not available in Dart.
Use Cases:
Image Processing: Using native libraries for image manipulation.
Cryptography: Leveraging existing C libraries for
cryptographic operations.
Hardware Interaction: Interfacing with hardware
components that have C/C++ drivers.
Example:
Add Dependencies: Add the ffi package to your pubspec.yaml.
Create a C Library: Write and compile your C code.
Define Dart Bindings: Use the ffi package to define
Dart bindings for the C functions.
Load the Library: Load the shared library in Dart
and call the functions.

62. Github Actions
https://github.com/features/actions
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous
delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build,
 test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that
 run tests whenever you push a change to your repository, or
 that deploy merged pull requests to production.

60. Lifecycle method of Statefull WIdget
https://medium.com/@hadiyaaamir222/lifecycle-of-a-stateful-widget-aece2d56c946


59 Dependency injection
Dependency injection plays a crucial role when working with
different environments in a Flutter application. It allows us to
 define different implementations of the same class for different
  environments, such as development, staging, and production.

45. Flutter widgets
Flutter questions:
What is a Widget Widget:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE7khGHVkYY&ab_channel=GoogleforDevelopers

Widgets are configurations for pieces of apps UI
Widget are configurations for elements.
Elements is a widget that has been made real and mounted on the
screen.
Element tree represents what is displayed on the device.
Each widget class has both a corresponding element class
and a method to create an instance.

41. where should we use sealed classes

Example: We should use them in the ui to check the type of received error.
abstract class cannot be instantiated

A sealed class cannot be extended or implemented outside of its library (file).
A sealed class is implicitly an abstract class and it cannot be instantiated

A 'final class' cannot be implemented or extended outside of the same library



39. HTTP error codes 
error 400 are such that happen from the client side and we should not retry
the request if such error happen, but search for the cause of the error
in the app 

1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process.
2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood,
 and accepted.
3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to
 complete the request.
4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
 fulfilled.
 400 Bad Request: This status code indicates that the server
 could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently
valid request.

40. explain mapping dto
we should have one model for the incoming data , it is better to
 have nullable fields
for it if the response changes
class UserDto {
  final String? name;
  UserDto({ this.name,});
}
we should have another model for the data in the ui 
so that when the API returns a different JSON structure
we fix the mapping of the dto and fix the class that is at the 
data source layer.

9. app performance
reduce app size memory:
 - remove unused code
 - minimize plugins, packages,
 - compress pictures and videos 
 
 https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/build-modes
 Use profile mode when you want to analyze performance.
 Common problems:
 - rebuilding ui more than necessary - this happens when you do
 things in the build method , which should not be there
 
 Best practice:
 - avoid repetitive work in build method
 - split up widgets in smaller widgets
 - if needed use isolates
 - use effects like opacity or collor filter only when necessary
 - build lists lazily with ListView.builder()
 - when using animations try to rebuild as little as possible
 - avoid clipping animation
 - don't pass long lists into constructor
 
 - setup code linting rules
 - single responsibility for the widgets - this makes it easier
  to refactor and understand
 - keep widgets small 
 - setup ci/cd from beginning
 - do not hard code colors and style, but use a theme

15. OOP principles

15.1 - Inheritance
- Inheritance concept is achieved by using the extends keyword
- class Duck extends Bird - Duck (derived, subclass), Bird(base, superclass)
- Extends is used for sharing behavior between superclass and subclass
- fields and methods inside the superclass are available in the subclass
- the superclass can be accessed by using the super keyword
- all dart classes extend only 1 class(Object class by default)
-The concept of polimorphism can be achieved in 1 way:
@override method.
- you can tighten a type by using the covariant keyword 
This helps to promote code reusability
and a hierarchical classification of classes.
https://www.darttutorial.org/dart-tutorial/dart-inheritance/

15.2 Abstraction
- abstraction concept is achieved by the 'implements' keyword
- abstract methods can be declared in abstract class
- abstract class is used as a contract, which should be implemented
and all of its abstract methods should be overridden and implemented, 
with functionality. The properties of the abstract class also should
 be implemented
- implements keyword forces the behavior of the parent class in the child
class. 
- many classes can be implemented
- abstract class cannot be instantiated
- every class is an implicit interface, even if its methods are not abstract
they can be overriden and implement in a child class 
- in not abstract class there can be an abstract method, which should 
start with the 'external' keyword, which denotes that the implementation
of the method should be in the child class of the current one, which
either extends or implements the current one.
- when a class only implements classes, we cannot use the super keyword
inside it to access porent class methods, fields and constructor 
 

15.3. Mixins
- Mixins are used to share behavior between one or more classes
- in dart , you can extend one single class, implement or mixins
one or more classes
- The order in which you write the mixins after the with keyword matters
- a mixin cannot be instantiated, it cannot have a constructor
a mixin that mixes in with other class can use its methods and 
can even override some of them 
- both  'mixin' and 'mixin class' cannot have a constructor , 
-Mixins and mixin classes cannot have an extends clause, and must 
not declare any generative constructors.
Example with on:
class Musician {}
mixin MusicalPerformer on Musician {}
class SingerDancer extends Musician with MusicalPerformer {}
In the preceding code, only classes that extend or implement the
Musician class can use the mixin MusicalPerformer. Because 
SingerDancer extends Musician, SingerDancer can mix in MusicalPerformer.
-Mixins can’t have extends or with clauses, so neither can a mixin class.
- Classes can’t have an on clause, so neither can a mixin class.






27. Design patterns

- singleton 
https://medium.com/@kishore_p18/singleton-in-dart-2c4f63c2b60c#:~:text=Singleton%20pattern%20restricts%20the%20instantiation,logging%2C%20drivers%20objects%20and%20caching.
Singleton pattern is a Creational Software Design Pattern 
that restricts the instantiation of a class to one “single” 
instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed
to coordinate actions across the application.
Why should we use Singleton pattern?

Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures 
that only one instance of the class exists.
The singleton class provides a global access point to get the instance 
of the class.
Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects and caching.

Usage:
In flutter - it can be used with sockets
- can be used when we want only 1 instance of our database available
- FirebaseAuth.instance  uses the singleton pattern 

Advantage:
- You are sure the class has only 1 instance
- You get a global access point to that instance
- You cannot override the value of the instance from outside of the Singleton class

Disatvantage
- The pattern violates the single responsibility principle, because it serves
for two purposes, has 2 responsibilities:
- provides 1 instance
- provides global access point to the instance
- singletons are hard to test
- if it is not initialised in a lazy way, then when we call the instance creation, it
 will be created, even if it is not used.
- singletons stay alive as long as the app is alive 

-Factory Method Pattern

https://scottt2.github.io/design-patterns-in-dart/factory_method/#:~:text=The%20factory%20method%20pattern%20is,object%20that%20will%20be%20created.

The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory 
methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having 
to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This 
is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either 
specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or
 implemented in a base class and optionally overridden 
by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.
- disatvantage - makes code difficult to read 


- Adapter Pattern:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eNhD6ZQ6hQ&list=RDCMUC-1kzHtwBY8n0TY5NhYxNaw&start_radio=1&rv=3eNhD6ZQ6hQ&t=142&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with 
incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

The Adapter pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be
 used as another interface, making it compatible with a client's requirements.
Example: Adapting a third-party library or legacy code to work with
 your application's interfaces.

- abstract factory pattern
Serves as alternative to facade pattern 
It can be used alog with bridge pattern
It can be implemented as singleton

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEg1CBKuqFg&list=PLlzmAWV2yTgB-1LdoO-9vCTgrE-1dyWKP&index=3&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat

- prototype pattern
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects
 without making your code dependent on their classes.


- decorator pattern
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new 
behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper 
objects that contain the behaviors.

- 1. Single responsibility- every class or method should have only 
one responsibility
It should know and understand only how this thing work.
 It should have single reason to change

- 2. Open closed principle - every class or method should be open for extension, but 
closed for modification
When we want new functionality to a class, instead of adding it to the class directly
we use the decorator pattern, which implements the same interface,
which the class is implementing
and add the functionality there . In this case, we do not break the unit tests
 written to the
initial class methods. And additional consequences could arise, if we change existing
methods
- Also to add functionality we can use extension methods on a class and we will not change
the file in this way
- Using inheritance also a class functionality can be extended

- 3. Liskov substitution :
a subtipe should be replaceable by parent type
The child class, should be able to do everything that the parent class does
	Human
    |    |
  Adult Baby 
Example Adult implements Human,,  Baby implements Human


- 4. Interface segregation :
Do not force the subclass to use methods that it doesn't need 
An issue arises: If we use the repository structural design pattern, 
we use an abstract repository with a log ot methods , which are then
 implemented in a repository implementation class.
 
To avoid this : The gist of this principle is: you should create
 small interfaces with minimal methods. Or split the abstract repository method in several
 abstract repositories and implement only the one which is needed
https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/solid-principles-in-dart


- 5. Dependency inversion:
Favor abstraction over implementation 
High level modules, should not depend on low level modules without an abstraction

Extending an abstract class or implementing an interface 
is good but descending from a concrete class is bad

compilers
just in time compiler - 
take new code and inject it into the old code, which allows  hot reload, hot restart
of flutter. With jit you update only this part of the application that you need.
Ahead of time compiler - creates production ready code with one outcome which a conversion of
the dart language to something that the computer understands. We achieve performance 
boost. With jit we update the code on the runtime.

34 Flutter widget lifecycle:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjloInz3-I0&ab_channel=RobertBrunhage
When the 

- initState

- didChangeDependencies
When dependencies change, context also change. We can call something.of(context)
in the method, but it cannot be done in the initState(). 
If we call: ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments; and the settings have changed
but they are part of the dependencies then if it is called in the didChangeDependencies
there will be no error compared to calling it in initState.

- didUpdateWidget
Called whenever the widget configuration changes. Such as passing 
variables to the constructor. If we pass a duration for a controller
then it needs to update the duration of the controller and the method is called

-deactivate
Called when this object is removed from the tree.

- dispose - called  when the object is removed from the tree permanently 
called when you call Navigator.pushReplacement. Dispose here animation controllers,
timers, streams. 
If the dispose is not called, memory leaks can happen.



35 Flutter App lifecycle:
 - detached
The application is still hosted on the flutter engine, but is detached from any host views
After a destroyed view, due to navigator.pop()


 - inactive

The application does not receive user input
Example, when you take a phone call 


 - paused
When the app is not visible to the user , not responding to user input and
running in the background.
Ex: When the home button is pressed and the app minimizes
 
 - hidden 
 
 All views of an application are hidden, either because the application is
about to be paused (on iOS and Android), or because it has been minimized
 or placed on a desktop that is no longer visible (on non-web desktop), or
is running in a window or tab that is no longer visible (on the web).
 
 -resumed 

The application is visible and responding to user input 
It is called when you navigate back into the app

Questions:
- What is flutter?

A:It is a cross platform development toolkit by Google, which helps
to deploy on multiple platforms with a single code base and 
achieven great UI quickly

- What are the types of widgets in Flutter?
A: Stateful and Stateless

- What is the difference between StatefullWidget and StatelessWidget?
A: Statefull widgetts hold state of the widget and can be rebuild when
state changes.
In Stateless widget The build method of a stateless widget is
typically only called in three situations:
the first time the widget is inserted in the tree,
when the widget's parent changes its configuration (see Element.rebuild),
and when an InheritedWidget it depends on changes.
Read this for Stateless widget:

Statefull Widget:
https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html


- How to access the (screen size /  pixel density / aspect ration )in Flutter?
A: We can access screen size and other properties like pixel density, aspect
ration etc with help of MediaQuery. syntact: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width

- What is provide and how it works?
A: Provide is a simple way for state management, it works on the concept
of PUB-SUB, which means there is  one provide and multiple subscribers,
which are called consumers here. Whenever there is a chagne, with
notifyChangeListener it will update all the consumers.

- How do we access native feature of the Platform?
ed: Battery level. 
A: Plugins or method channel

- Other cross platform frameworks
A: Ionic

- Why do we need mixins?
A: Dart does NOT support multiple inheritance. Thus to implement the multiple
inheritance in Flutter, we need mixins. Mixins provide a way to write code in
multiple class hierarchies.

- What is tree shaking in Flutter?
A: An optimization technique to remove the unused module in the bundle during
the build process. It is a code elimination techniques used to optimize
our application.

- Material Design
A: Material Design is an open-source design system built and supported by
 Google designers and developers.

- 3 modes of compiling
- debug, profile, release
Debug - compilation is optimized for development in debug mode 
profile - debugging is enabled to profile your app’s performance.
Profile mode is disabled on the emulator and simulator.
release - for deploying the app,for maximum optimization. Debuggin and
 assertions are disabled.

- Flutter module:
Flutter can be embedded into your existing Android application , as 
a source code Gradle subproject or as AARs.
https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/android/project-setup
flutter Module is flutter code, which is used in your native code for android
or ios 

- Flutter plugin
Native code for android or ios , which you use in the flutter app 

- null aware operator
x ??= y
We assign y to x only if x is null .


z = x ?? y 
x is assigned to z , if x is not null
if x is null , y is assigned to z

- What is the use of FormState
A: State associated with a Form widget. A FormState object can be used
 to save, reset, and validate every FormField that is a descendant of the associated Form.
Typically obtained via Form.of.

- What is a key?
A: A unique identifier of a widget

- How to dismiss the keyboard programmatically?
A: FocusScope.of(context).unfocus();

- What is the use of await?
A: Is is only used inside an async. It suspends currently running function
until the result is completed. The result is completed with a future.

- What is the use of double.infinity?
A: It is used to when you want to specify the widget should be as big as a parent

- What is the use of SafeArea widget?
A: It'a a widget that makes it easy to place our widgets in a portion of the
view thats unobscured by bars and other content like status bars

- How to close or dismiss keyboard in flutter?
FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(FocusNode());

- Explain tween animations
A: Tween animation is also know as betweening. In tween animations, we defin the
beginning and the end of the animation, and the framework itself calculates how 
to transition the widget to fulfill values.

- What is pubspec.yaml?
A: It allows you to define the packages your app relies on, declare assets like
images, video. It allows you to set contraints for your app.

- What is the difference between NetworkImage and Image.network()?
A: NetworkImage creates and object, which provide an image from src URL.

Image.network is aA named constructor, which creates a widget 
that displays an image on the screen
obtained from the network.

1 option: 
late NetworkImage image;
in initState:
image = const NetworkImage('https://picsum.photos/250?image=9');
in the build method:
Image(image: image),

2nd option in the build method:
Image.network('https://picsum.photos/250?image=9'),

slide 35 
static variable 
- Allocate memory only once in class area at the time of class loading
- Used to refer to the common variables of all objects

static method:
- Can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of the class
- Can access static data member and can change the value of it
- Cannot access non-static(instance) members or call non-static methods


static methods

================================
dart const constructor

Improves the performance of the program.
the hashcode of two const constructors is the same, if the values
passed to the constructor are the same

============= (UseCase, Service, Repository, Data) ========================
in clean architecture
what are use cases used for
https://engineering.teknasyon.com/usecase-red-flags-and-best-practices-in-clean-architecture-76e2f6d921eb

UseCase
It is used for interactions of user with the system such as sign up, login
The use case is responsible for encapsulating the business logic for a single
reusable task the system must perform.

============== ( Service ) ===============

what are services used for

https://dev.to/blazebrain/using-services-in-flutter-572h
https://medium.com/coding-with-flutter/flutter-designing-an-authentication-api-with-service-classes-45ec8d55963e#:~:text=Service%20classes%20are%20a%20good,a%20good%20example%20of%20this).


Service classes are a good way of hiding the implementation
details of 3rd party code in your app.
They can be particularly useful when you need to call an API method
in multiple places in your codebase (analytics and logging
libraries are a good example of this).

abstract AuthService , which has method declarations
FirebaseAuthService implements AuthService =
method implementations
FirebaseAuthService contains the implementation of the methods declared in the AuthService class.
Each method wraps a method from the Firebase instance
Example:
https://github.com/bizz84/firebase_auth_demo_flutter/tree/master/lib/services

================ (Repository ) ==================

what are repositories used for
https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5AseKQh2ZE&ab_channel=AndroidDevelopers

They are used to INTERACT WITH DATA SOURCE CLASSES
-expose data to the rest of the app
-centralize changes to the data
-resolve conflicts between multiple data sources
There should be one repository per data type
Ex: MoviesRepository for Movie data type
