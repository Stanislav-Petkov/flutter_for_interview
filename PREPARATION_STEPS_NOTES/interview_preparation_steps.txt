45. Flutter widgets
Flutter questions:
What is a Widget Widget: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE7khGHVkYY&ab_channel=GoogleforDevelopers

Widgets are configurations for pieces of apps UI
Widget are configurations for elements.
Elements is a widget that has been made real and mounted on the
screen.
Element tree represents what is displayed on the device.
Each widget class has both a corresponding element class
and a method to create an instance.

47. Flutter mock interview
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xtCKUImrjw&ab_channel=AkshitMadan



41. where should we use sealed classes

Example: We should use them in the ui to check the type of received error 
abstract class cannot be instantiated

A sealed class cannot be extended or implemented outside of its library (file).
A sealed class is implicitly an abstract class and it cannot be instantiated

A 'final class' cannot be implemented or extended outside of the same library



39. HTTP error codes 
error 400 are such that happen from the client side and we should not retry
the request if such error happen, but search for the cause of the error
in the app 

40. explain mapping dto
we should have one model for the incoming data 
we should have another model for the data in the ui 
so that when the API returns a different JSON structure
we fix the mapping of the dto and fix the class that is at the 
data source layer.

flutter pub get && flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs


9. app performance
reduce app size memory:
 - remove unused code
 - minimize plugins, packages,
 - compress pictures and videos 
 
 https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/build-modes
 Use profile mode when you want to analyze performance.
 Common problems:
 - rebuilding ui more than necessary - this happens when you do
 things in the build method , which should not be there
 
 Best practice:
 - avoid repetitive work in build method
 - split up widgets in smaller widgets
 - if needed use isolates
 - use effects like opacity or collor filter only when necessary
 - build lists lazyly with ListView.builder()
 - when using animations try to rebuild as little as possible
 - avoid clipping animation
 - don't pass long lists into constructor
 
 - setup code linting rules
 - single responsibility for the widgets - this makes it easier to refactor and understand
 - keep widgets small 
 - setup ci/cd from begining
 - do not hard code colors and style, but use a theme

15. OOP principles

15.1 - Inheritance
- Inheritance concept is achieved by using the extends keyword
- class Duck extends Bird - Duck (derived, subclass), Bird(base, superclass)
- Extends is used for sharing behavior between superclass and subclass
- fields and methods inside the superclass are available in the subclass
- the superclass can be accessed by using the super keyword
- all dart classes extend only 1 class(Object class by default)
-The concept of polimorphism can be achieved in 1 way:
@override method.
- you can tighten a type by using the covariant keyword 

15.2 Abstraction
- abstraction concept is achieved by the 'implements' keyword
- abstract methods can be declared in abstract class
- abstract class is used as a constract, which should be implemented
and all of its abstract methods should be overridden and implemented, 
with functionality. The properties of the abstract class also should
 be implemented
- implements keyword forces the behavior of the parent class in the child
class. 
- many classes can be implemented
- abstract class cannot be instantiated
- every class is an implicit interface, even if its methods are not abstract
they can be overriden and implement in a child class 
- in not abstract class there can be an abstract method, which should 
start with the 'external' keyword, which denotes that the implementation
of the method should be in the child class of the current one, which
either extends or implements the current one.
- when a class only implements classes, we cannot use the super keyword
inside it to access porent class methods, fields and constructor 
 

15.3. Mixins
- Mixins are used to share behavior between one or more classes
- in dart , you can extend one single class, implement or mixins
one or more classes
- The order in which you write the mixins after the with keyword matters
- a mixin cannot be instantiated, it cannot have a constructor
a mixin that mixes in with other class can use its methods and 
can even override some of them 
- both  'mixin' and 'mixin class' cannot have a constructor , 
-Mixins and mixin classes cannot have an extends clause, and must 
not declare any generative constructors.
Example with on:
class Musician {}
mixin MusicalPerformer on Musician {}
class SingerDancer extends Musician with MusicalPerformer {}
In the preceding code, only classes that extend or implement the
Musician class can use the mixin MusicalPerformer. Because 
SingerDancer extends Musician, SingerDancer can mix in MusicalPerformer.
-Mixins can’t have extends or with clauses, so neither can a mixin class.
- Classes can’t have an on clause, so neither can a mixin class.






27. Design patterns

- singleton 
https://medium.com/@kishore_p18/singleton-in-dart-2c4f63c2b60c#:~:text=Singleton%20pattern%20restricts%20the%20instantiation,logging%2C%20drivers%20objects%20and%20caching.
Singleton pattern is a Creational Software Design Pattern 
that restricts the instantiation of a class to one “single” 
instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed
to coordinate actions across the application.
Why should we use Singleton pattern?

Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures 
that only one instance of the class exists.
The singleton class provides a global access point to get the instance 
of the class.
Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects and caching.

Usage:
In flutter - it can be used with sockets
- can be used when we want only 1 instance of our database available
- FirebaseAuth.instance  uses the singleton pattern 

Advantage:
- You are sure the class has only 1 instance
- You get a global access point to that instance
- You cannot override the value of the instance from outside of the Singleton class

Disatvantage
- The pattern violates the single responsibility principle, because it serves
for two purposes, has 2 responsibilities:
- provides 1 instance
- provides global access point to the instance
- singletons are hard to test
- if it is not initialised in a lazy way, then when we call the instance creation, it
 will be created, even if it is not used.
- singletons stay alive as long as the app is alive 

-Factory Method Pattern

https://scottt2.github.io/design-patterns-in-dart/factory_method/#:~:text=The%20factory%20method%20pattern%20is,object%20that%20will%20be%20created.

The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory 
methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having 
to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This 
is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either 
specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or
 implemented in a base class and optionally overridden 
by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.
- disatvantage - makes code difficult to read 


- Adapter Pattern:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eNhD6ZQ6hQ&list=RDCMUC-1kzHtwBY8n0TY5NhYxNaw&start_radio=1&rv=3eNhD6ZQ6hQ&t=142&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with 
incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

The Adapter pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be
 used as another interface, making it compatible with a client's requirements.
Example: Adapting a third-party library or legacy code to work with
 your application's interfaces.

- abstract factory pattern
Serves as alternative to facade pattern 
It can be used alog with bridge pattern
It can be implemented as singleton

 Pros and Cons


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEg1CBKuqFg&list=PLlzmAWV2yTgB-1LdoO-9vCTgrE-1dyWKP&index=3&ab_channel=RivaanRanawat

- prototype pattern
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects
 without making your code dependent on their classes.


- decorator pattern
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new 
behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper 
objects that contain the behaviors.

- 1. Single responsibility- every class or method should have only 
one responsibility
It should know and understand only how this thing work.
 It should have single reason to change

- 2. Open closed principle - every class or method should be open for extension, but 
closed for modification
When we want new functionality to a class, instead of adding it to the class directly
we use the decorator pattern, which implements the same interface, which the class is implenting
and add the functionality there . In this case, we do not break the unit tests writen to the
initial class methods. And additional consequences could arise, if we change existing
methods
- Also to add functionality we can use extension methods on a class and we will not change
the file in this way
- Using inheritance also a class functionality can be extended

- 3. Liskov substitution :
a subtipe should be replacable by parent type
The child class, should be able to do everything that the parent class does
	Human
    |    |
  Adult Baby 
Example Adult implements Human,,  Baby implements Human


- 4. Interface segregation :
Do not force the subclass to use methods that it doesn't need 
An issue arises: If we use the repository structural design pattern, 
we use an abstract repository with a log ot methods , which are then
 implemented in a repository implementation class.
 
To avoid this : The gist of this principle is: you should create
 small interfaces with minimal methods. Or split the abstract repository method in several
 absttract repositories and implement only the one which is needed 
https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/solid-principles-in-dart


- dependency inversion:
Favor abstraction over implementation 
High level modules, should not depend on low level modules without an abstraction

Extending an abstract class or implementing an interface 
is good but descending from a concrete class is bad

32. 
compilers
just in time compiler - 
take new code and inject it into the old code, which allows  hot reload, hot restard
of flutter. With jit you update only this part of the application that you need.
Ahead of time compiler - creates production ready code with one outcome which a convertion of
the dart language to something that the computer understands. We achieve performance 
boost. With jit we update the code on the runtime.

Concurency:
The isolate allows async functions to run in a different dart vm

When the heavy computation answer is ready , it is injected into the code

34 Flutter widget lifecycle:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjloInz3-I0&ab_channel=RobertBrunhage
When the 

- initState

- didChangeDependencies
When dependencies change, context also change. We can call something.of(context)
in the method, but it cannot be done in the initState(). 
If we call: ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments; and the settings have changed
but they are part of the dependencies then if it is called in the didChangeDependencies
there will be no error compared to calling it in initState.

- didUpdateWidget
Called whenever the widget configuration changes. Such as passing 
variables to the constructor. If we pass a duration for a controller
then it needs to update the duration of the controller and the mehtod is called

-deactivate
Called when this object is removed from the tree.

- dispose - called  when the object is removed from the tree permanently 
called when you call Navigator.pushReplacement. Dispose here animation controllers,
timers, streams. 
If the dispose is not called, memory leaks can happen.



35 Flutter App lifecycle:
 - detached
The application is still hosted on the flutter engine, but is detached from any host views
After a destroyed view, due to navigator.pop()


 - inactive

The application does not receive user input
Example, when you take a phone call 


 - paused
When the app is not visible to the user , not responding to user input and
running in the background.
Ex: When the home button is pressed and the app minimizes
 
 - hidden 
 
 All views of an application are hidden, either because the application is
about to be paused (on iOS and Android), or because it has been minimized
 or placed on a desktop that is no longer visible (on non-web desktop), or
is running in a window or tab that is no longer visible (on the web).
 
 -resumed 

The application is visible and responding to user input 
It is called when you navigate back into the app

- Dart
- OOP
- Dart collections
- Asynchronous programming
- generator functions
Flutter framework
- Stateful vs Stateless widget
- BuildContext
- package vs plugins
- hot restart vs hot reload
- UI (Scaffold, Row , Column ))

Very important:
When to use which and why:
- State management (Provider, BLoc), GIT

What are and how to use them
- Advanced Asynchronous programming(Streams, Isolates, Event Loops)
- Responsive UI, Test(unit, widget, integration), 

Important:
- Project Architecture - how to organise a project, how to make it scallable
- Firebase services
- CI/CD(Codemagic, Bitrise, Github Actions)
- Performance, 
- app release - best practices for app release

What tools and packages would you use for :
- fully reponsible mobile app,
- real time multiuse app,
- background location based app

Practica small test task
- setup for a state management solution
- network calls !!!
- ui implementation of screens

Questions:
- What is flutter?

A:It is a cross platform development toolkit by Google, which helps
to deploy on multiple platforms with a single code base and 
achieven great UI quickly

- What are the types of widgets in Flutter?
A: Stateful and Stateless

- What is the difference between StatefullWidget and StatelessWidget?
A: Statefull widgetts hold state of the sidget and can be rebuild when
state changes. Whereas Stateless widgets are build only when it is 
created or the parent changes.

- How to access the (screen size /  pixel density / aspect ration )in Flutter?
A: We can access screen size and other properties like pixel density, aspect
ration etc with help of MediaQuery. syntact: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width

- What is provide and how it works?
A: Provie is a simple way for state management, it works on the concept
of PUB-SUB, which means there is  one provide and multiple subscribers,
which are called consumers here. Whenever there is a chagne, with
notifyChangeListener it will update all the consumers.

- How do we access native feature of the Platform?
ed: Battery level. 
A: Plugins or method channel

- Other cross platform frameworks
A: Ionic

- Why do we need mixins?
A: Dart does NOT support multiple inheritance. Thus to implement the multiple
inheritance in Flutter, we need mixins. Mixins provide a way to write code in
multiple class hierarchies.

- What is tree shaking in Flutter?
A: An optimization technique to remove the unused module in the bundle during
the build process. It is a code elimination techniques used to optimize
our application.

- Material Design
A: Material Design is an open-source design system built and supported by
 Google designers and developers.

- 3 modes of compiling
- debug, profile, release
Debug - compilation is optimized for development in debug mode 
profile - debugging is enabled to profile your app’s performance.
Profile mode is disabled on the emulator and simulator.
release - for deploying the app,for maximum optimization. Debuggin and
 assertions are disabled.

- Flutter module:
Flutter can be embedded into your existing Android application , as 
a source code Gradle subproject or as AARs.
https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/android/project-setup
flutter Module is flutter code, which is used in your native code for android
or ios 

- Flutter plugin
Native code for android or ios , which you use in the flutter app 

- null aware operator
x ??= y
We assign y to x only if x is null .


z = x ?? y 
x is assigned to z , if x is not null
if x is null , y is assigned to z

- What is the use of FormState
A: State associated with a Form widget. A FormState object can be used
 to save, reset, and validate every FormField that is a descendant of the associated Form.
Typically obtained via Form.of.

- What is a key?
A: A unique identifier of a widget

- How to dismiss the keyboard programmatically?
A: FocusScope.of(context).unfocus();

- What is the use of await?
A: Is is only used inside an async. It suspends currently running function
until the result is completed. The result is completed with a future.

- What is the use of double.infinity?
A: It is used to when you want to specify the widget should be as big as a parent

- What is the use of SafeArea widget?
A: It'a a widget that makes it easy to place our widgets in a portion of the
view thats unobscured by bars and other content like status bars

- How to clos or dismiss keyboard in flutter?
FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(FocusNode());

- Explain tween animations
A: Tween animation is also know as betweening. In tween animations, we defin the
beginning and the end of the animation, and the framework itself calculates how 
to transition the widget to fulfill values.

- What is pubspec.yaml?
A: It allows you to defin the packages your app relies on, declare assets like
images, video. It allows you to set contraints for your app.

- What is the difference between NetworkImage and Image.network()?
A: NetworkImage creates and object, which provide an image from src URL.

Image.network is aA named constructor, which creates a widget 
that displays an image on the screen
obtained from the network.

1 option: 
late NetworkImage image;
in initState:
image = const NetworkImage('https://picsum.photos/250?image=9');
in the build method:
Image(image: image),

2nd option in the build method:
Image.network('https://picsum.photos/250?image=9'),

- How do you override the back-button action?
A: by using the WillPopScope widget 

- What are the different types of gridview?
A: GridView.count(), GridView.builder(),GridView.custom(),
GridView.extend()

- What is ScopedModel / BloC Pattern?
A: ScopedModel and BLoC(Business Logic Components) are common Flutter app
arhitecture patterns to help separated business logic from UI and using fewer
StatefulWidgets

- Explain Flutter inspector
A: The inspector is a powerful tool for visualizin and exploring Flutter widget
trees. It is very useful for understanding existing layouts and Diagnosing layout
issues.

- What are the types of List views?
A: ListView, ListView.builder(), ListView.separated, ListView.custom
